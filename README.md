## 📖 Story behind the project

When my brother was going to buy his first apartment he got frusterated about how the prices increased tremendously once the bidding process started. He found it difficult to predict what the final price would become for different types of apartments that he was interested in. His frusteration got me interested in what apartment I could buy for X SEK and which factors I should take into consideration (such as time of the year, broker etc) when buying an apartment. 

I could not find any free dataset to fetch Stockholm's real estate data from so my friend Hannes coded a [web scraper](https://github.com/hannesbrinklert/Hemnet-web-scraping) that scrapes the data from Hemnet, Sweden's largest real estate marketplace.
