# Homerun
Homerun is a data visualization tool that helps you make a "homerun" on your next apartment purchase by comparing different types of apartments. The tool is based on data scraped from Hemnet.se during 2020. The tool is built in React and Material UI and the data is scraped with Python.

  ## About the data
  The data is scraped in python by my friend Hannes. He is currently working on a python script that will collect all the data from the sold apartments in Stockholm on hemnet.se. View his progress here: https://github.com/hannesbrinklert/Hemnet-web-scraping. While this data is being collected I am using "fake" data and this is the data you can see in the screenshots above.
