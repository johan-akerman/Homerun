## Technologies used

I built the frontend in React JS, Material UI and Chart JS. My friend Hannes scraped the data with Python.

## Story about the project

When my older brother was going to buy his first apartment he used to get frusterated about how the prices increased tremendously once the bidding process started. He found it difficult to predict what the final price would be for the type of apartments that he was interested in. It got me interested in what kind of apartment X SEK could get you in Stockholm and what factors you should take into consideration (such as time of the year, broker etc) when buying an apartment. I talked to my friend Hannes and we started discussing how we could apply programming to solve this problem. We came up with the idea to scrape the web for sold apartments. Our main idea was to let the user apply different filters to sort the data and then visualize the result in various charts. The result? Homerun 👇

## How Homerun works

<strong>Step 1:</strong> The user gets greeted by a homepage with some instructions.<br>

	<br />

<strong>Step 2:</strong> The user can add filters for what kind of apartments they want to learn more about. Multiple filters could be added at the same time to compare different types of apartments. <br /><br>

	<br />



<strong>Step 3:</strong> Each added filter gets its own color (see panel on the left). The data for that specific filter is then displayed in the same color in the graphs. <br /><br>

<strong>Step 4:</strong> The user can choose to view a specific chart card in fullscreen for greater details.<br /><br>
