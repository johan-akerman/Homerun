Homerun
Interested in making a homerun when buying your next home? Or perhaps when selling your current home? Cool, we got you covered. By scraping the web we have gathered tons of data about the Stockholm real estate market. With the help of this data, we have made it easy for you to compare different areas within Stockholm and see what different types of apartment have been valued at in the past. All with the purpose of making it as easy as possible for you to make the best deal when buying a new home or selling your current one. To put it simple, we help you make a homerun! 

PS, this project is currently under development.
