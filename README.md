# Homerun
Homerun is a data visualization tool that helps you make a "homerun" on your next apartment purchase by comparing different types of apartments. The tool is based on data scraped from Hemnet.se during 2020. The frontend is built in React and Material UI. The data is scraped with Python.

Each added "filter" will get it's own color (see sidebar on the left). The data from each filter is visualized with a line in each chart in that color. 

## How to use it
1. Add a filter of the apartments you are interested in
2. Observe the data visualizations
3. Add more filters if you would like to compare different types of apartments against each other.

  ## About the data
  The data is scraped in python by my friend Hannes. He is currently working on a python script that collects all the data from the sold apartments during 2020 (in Stockholm) from hemnet.se. The data is then being transformed into a json file. View his progress here: https://github.com/hannesbrinklert/Hemnet-web-scraping. While this script is being completed and the data is being collected, I am using fake data and this is the data that you can see in the screenshots above.
